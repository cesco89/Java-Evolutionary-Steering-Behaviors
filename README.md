# Java Evolutionary Steering Behaviors


This program is roughly based on [CodingTrain's P5.js Code](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning/tree/master/week2-evolution/01_evolve_steering)
The program also uses PVector class and some other couple methods, roughly taken from Processing Source Code:
- [lerpColor() & lerp()](https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/master/core/src/processing/core/PGraphics.java)
- [PVector.java](https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/master/core/src/processing/core/PVector.java) (with minor additions)

Basically this is just a personal challenge to start digging in genetic algorithms and i haven't made great additions to Daniel's code.

A huge thanks goes to [Daniel Shiffman] (https://github.com/shiffman)
